# Notes template

Template designed with the objective of offering a simple and organized base on which to write-down notes, 
cheat-sheets, formulae, and essays.

## Compilation

As all other `.tex`, `.bib` files are either included or inputted into `notex.tex`, to compile this template run:

```
pdflatex notes.tex
```

Alternatively, `lualatex` or `xelatex` can be used to compile the source files.

IMPORTANT: Rerunning the aforementioned command will be necessary for the output to be correct.
